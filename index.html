    <br />
    <br />
   <p>  A self-directed, ever-learning individual from Jacksonville, Florida.
      I am an Early College graduate from Sandalwood High School and Florida State College at Jacksonville, who currently is studying at University of Central Florida for a B.S in Computer Science.
      I am interested in traveling, public speaking, creating, government, and web development.
 I have a diverse array of interests that I use to create my services.

    <p> I have been teaching myself programming through freeCodeCamp between school, which is where you will find the most activity.
      While I know how to write HTML/CSS, I am currently teaching myself Javascript to become a better developer. I expect the Internet to be more connected to our lives in the future, which is why I focus on the web.
      I still have some ideas for other platforms like mobile, but currently this is my focus. I also like to write, so expect articles on Medium.com about what I know and what I find interested in the field of front-end.
    Below is where I host almost all my work and projects.</p>

    <br />

    <!---Why-->
    <h1 id="speak">I can speak</h1>
    <br />
      <p>
      I have speaking publicly like most people as an assignment, but after my first taste of the world of
      public speaking, I was hooked. I have spoken in the Modern Woodsmen Speech Competition in my middle school and
      in the YMCA Youth in Government program as a student legislator presenting my bill ideas to fellow congressmen.
      I have spoken on a panel for the American Association of Communitiy Colleges of a discussion of academic achievement and diversity,
      and won awards representing FSCJ Forensics teamin the 2017-18 school year.
      </p>
<p>
One of the things I love about public speaking is how much of an impact my speech has on other people. After my lastest presentation,
the organizer for the event, Charles Smires of the College Retires Association, wrote
</p>
<p><i> "I knew that the majority of the attendees would know very little about forensics, and I wanted this opportunity to showcase how talented forensics students are.
   I am sure you could tell by the audience response they were impressed by you...One member after the today's meeting told me it was the best program we had all year!"</i></p>

        <!---Why-->
        <h1 id="notary">I can notarize</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
         Until about a few months ago  I really did not knew what a notary was, but I decided to learn what a notary is and how to become one.
        Today I am still learning new responsibilities and powers to build an understanding of the field and help the state of Florida.
         I was commissed to by our Florida Governor to be a Notary Public from 2018 to 2022.</p>
